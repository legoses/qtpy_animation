In its current iteration, this is pretty rough, but it should provide enough functionality for basic animations. <br>

Before using, make sure you have circuit python installed. <br>
Currently, this only works for 14x4 displays. <br>

Basic Usage: <br>
Create a two dimensional list. Each nested list will contain the two bytes to control which semgments are lit up, and the grid number they will be displayed on.
